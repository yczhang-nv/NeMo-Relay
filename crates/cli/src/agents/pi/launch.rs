//! Transparent launch for pi.
//!
//! pi differs from Codex and Claude Code in two ways that shape this module.
//!
//! **Hooks cannot be injected from outside.** Codex takes `--config hooks.*=...`
//! and Claude Code reads a settings file, so their launchers can install hook
//! commands directly. pi has no native hook-configuration file and its external
//! stream is observation-only, so hook calls must originate inside an extension.
//! Launch therefore loads the NeMo Relay extension with `-e` and passes the
//! gateway URL through the environment for it to read.
//!
//! **Model traffic cannot be redirected by a flag or a generic env var.** pi
//! resolves `baseUrl` per model from its generated catalog; the only documented
//! override points are per-provider (`AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `LLAMA_BASE_URL`)
//! or a provider registered by an extension. So redirection is the extension's
//! job too, and this module only supplies the URL.
