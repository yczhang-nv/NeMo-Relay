/**
 * Points pi's model traffic at the NeMo Relay gateway.
 *
 * pi has no base-URL flag and no generic environment override -- it resolves a
 * base URL per model from a generated catalog -- so redirection has to happen
 * inside the extension. The mechanism is one call:
 *
 * ```ts
 * pi.registerProvider(providerId, { baseUrl: gatewayUrl });
 * ```
 *
 * With `baseUrl` and no `models`, pi rewrites the URL of every existing model
 * for that provider and keeps their API, headers, costs and context windows
 * (`applyExtension`, pi `v0.84.0`, `core/provider-composer.ts:215`). That is far
 * cheaper than pi's own `custom-provider-*` examples, which register a
 * `streamSimple` and re-implement a provider protocol; the extension stays a
 * thin client.
 *
 * **Redirection is conditional, and the condition is the whole design.** The
 * gateway forwards to one statically configured upstream per API family and a
 * client cannot override it per request -- inbound internal dispatch headers
 * are stripped. So sending a model's traffic to the gateway is only correct
 * when the gateway's upstream *is* the endpoint that model would otherwise
 * call. Redirecting an NVIDIA model into a gateway configured for
 * `api.openai.com` does not degrade to "no spans"; it breaks the session.
 *
 * The launcher therefore passes the gateway's own upstreams
 * (`NEMO_RELAY_PI_OPENAI_UPSTREAM`, `NEMO_RELAY_PI_ANTHROPIC_UPSTREAM`) and
 * this module redirects only on a match. Unmatched models keep their own
 * endpoint and produce no LLM spans, which is the honest outcome.
 */

/**
 * The API families the gateway serves, mapped to the upstream that backs each.
 *
 * A `Map` rather than an object literal because pi does not constrain this key:
 * `api` is `KnownApi | (string & {})` and reaches us from models.json, remote
 * catalogs and other extensions. On an object literal an `api` of `constructor`
 * or `__proto__` resolves through the prototype chain to something truthy, so
 * the unserviceable-API guard -- whose whole job is to keep a model the gateway
 * cannot route out of the gateway -- would not fire, and the model was scored
