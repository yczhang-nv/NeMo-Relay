/**
 * NeMo Relay extension for the pi coding agent.
 *
 * pi has no native hook-configuration file and its external stream is
 * observation-only, so hook calls must originate inside an extension. This one
 * is a thin HTTP client to the NeMo Relay CLI gateway: it forwards pi's
 * lifecycle to `/hooks/pi`, and gates tool calls on the gateway's verdict.
 *
 * **Governance, on two paths.** For model-invoked tools, `tool_call` is the only
 * pre-execution decision point that sees arguments -- `--tools` /
 * `--exclude-tools` / `--no-tools` and the runtime `setActiveTools` are applied
 * at tool-registry construction, never per call. A gateway guardrail rejection
 * arrives as HTTP 403 and is translated into `{block, reason}`; pi hands that
 * reason to the model verbatim, so the model reads the guardrail's own words.
 *
 * The user's own bang-prefixed shell (`!cmd`) never reaches the tool registry,
 * so `tool_call` cannot see it. It is gated separately through `user_bash`,
 * under its own tool name and with a refusal shaped as a failed command rather
 * than as a blocked tool call, because pi gives that hook no reason contract.
 * See `src/user-bash.ts`.
 *
 * **Lifecycle mapping.** Two pi shapes make a naive mapping wrong:
 *
 * 1. *Agent-run re-entry.* One prompt can re-enter the agent run several times
 *    (provider retry, post-compaction, queued follow-up), and `turnIndex` resets
 *    to 0 each time, so turn indices collide within one prompt. The extension
 *    `agent_end` payload carries no `willRetry` marker, so a retry cannot be
 *    detected there -- `session_before_compact` is the one hook that announces
 *    one in advance, and only for the compaction case. `agent_settled` is the
 *    only event that fires exactly once per logical run. Every attributable
 *    hook therefore carries an attempt counter and a session-monotonic turn
 *    sequence, because the gateway's own model is flat (session -> turn ->
 *    tool) and cannot express the nesting. They travel as payload keys and the
 *    gateway promotes them into event metadata, which is what makes them
 *    survive on tool spans.
 * 2. *Concurrent tools.* pi preflights sibling calls sequentially then executes
 *    them concurrently, so `tool_execution_end` arrives out of submission order.
 *    All per-call state is keyed by `toolCallId`, which is the only correlator
 *    pi provides.
 *
 * Load it with `pi -e <path-to-this-file>`, or let `nemo-relay run --agent pi` do it.
 *
 * **Model redirection.** pi resolves a base URL per model from a generated
 * catalog, so the extension points the active model's provider at the gateway
 * itself -- but only when the gateway forwards to the endpoint that model would
 * otherwise call. See `src/provider-redirect.ts`.
 *
 * Environment (set by the launcher, overridable by hand):
 * - `NEMO_RELAY_PI_GATEWAY_URL`  gateway base URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:4040`)
 * - `NEMO_RELAY_PI_TIMEOUT_MS`   per-request timeout (default 5000)
 * - `NEMO_RELAY_PI_FAIL`         `closed` to block when the gateway is unreachable
 * - `NEMO_RELAY_PI_REDIRECT`     `force` to skip the upstream check, `off` to disable
 * - `NEMO_RELAY_PI_{OPENAI,ANTHROPIC}_UPSTREAM`  what the gateway forwards to

  /**
   * The second governance seam: pi's bang-prefixed inline shell.
   *
   * `!cmd` and `!!cmd` bypass the tool registry entirely -- they reach
   * `emitUserBash`, not `tool_call` -- so nothing about the tool gate covers
   * them. This closes that gap using the gateway machinery that already exists:
   * the command is posted as a tool start named `user_bash`, so the same
   * conditional-execution guardrail chain decides it and the same 403 contract
   * carries the reason back.
   *
   * Three pi facts shape every line of this handler.
   *
   * 1. **There is no block-and-reason contract.** A refusal is a synthetic
   *    failed `BashResult` and pi records it exactly as if the command had run.
   *    See `src/user-bash.ts` for the shape and why those field values.
   * 2. **`emitUserBash` catches**, so throwing fails *open* and the command
   *    runs unchecked. Nothing here is allowed to escape; the catch resolves an
   *    internal failure through the same policy as an unreachable gateway.
   * 3. **The first handler to return anything wins.** Loaded with `-e` this one
   *    is first; installed with `pi install` it loads last and an earlier
   *    extension can preempt it, in which case the gateway never sees the
   *    command at all.
   *
   * What the gate does *not* do is observe the command. pi has no completion
   * hook for inline shell -- `user_bash` is the only one -- so on an allow the
   * span closes immediately and measures the policy round trip, not the
   * command. Taking execution over to fix that would mean supplying pi with
   * custom `operations`, which drops the user's configured shell path and pi's
   * process-tree cancellation; the sidecar does not change how pi runs things.
